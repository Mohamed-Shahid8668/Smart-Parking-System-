SMART PARKING SYSTEM



Problem Definition:

The problem is to design an efficient and user- friendly car parking system that addresses the challenges associated with parking in crowded urban areas. This includes issues like finding available parking spaces, reducing congestion, and improving the overall parking experience for both drivers and parking lot operators.



Design thinking approach:

1.Empathize:

	Understand the needs and pain points of drivers, parking lot operators, and city planners 



	Conduct surveys, interviews, and observations to gather insights into the current parking system’s problems.



2.Define: 

	Clearly define the problem and its scope, including specific pain points and goals.

	Identify the target audience and their key requirements.





3.Ideate:

	Brainstorm innovative solutions to the identified problems.

	Encourage creativity among team members to generate a wide range of ideas.



4.Prototype:

	Create low-fidelity prototypes generate parking system concepts.

	Test these prototypes with real users to gather feedback and refine the designs.



5.Test:

	Conduct usability testing and gather feedback on the prototypes.

	Iterate on the designs based on user input qnd refine the parking system concept.



6.Implement:

	Develop a robust and scalable parking system based on the refined design.

	Ensure the system integrates with existing infrastructure and technologies.

7.Monitor:

	Continuously monitor the system’s performance and gather data on usage patterns.

	Use data analytics to identify areas for improvement and optimization.





Key design consideration:



1.Real-time considerations:

	Provide real-time information on available parking spaces to drivers through mobile apps and digital signature.



2.Payment and booking:

	Offer various payment options, including cashless payments and booking options for premium spaces.









3.Sustainability:

	Explore eco-friendly solutions such as electric vehicle charging stations and green parking infrastructure.



4.Accessibility:

	Ensure the system is accessibility to individuals with disabilities, with designated parking spaces and features for them.



5.Security:

	Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent vandalism or theft in parking areas.



6.Scalability:

	Design the system to accommodate future growth and expansion of parking facilities.



7.User Experience:

	Prioritize a seamless and enjoyable experience for both drivers and parking attendants.



8.Data Analytics:

	Use data analytics to optimize parking space allocation, pricing, and overall system performance.



9.Integrstion:

	Integrate the parking system with public transportation and navigation apps for a holistic mobility solution.





By following the design thinking process and considering these key factors, you can develop a car parking system that effectively addresses the identified problems and enhances the overall parking experience for all stakeholders.
